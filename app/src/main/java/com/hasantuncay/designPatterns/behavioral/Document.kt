 *
 * Below is an academic-style presentation of software design patterns categorized under three main types:
 * Structural, Behavioral, and Creational design patterns.
 *
 * ### Structural Design Patterns
 * Structural design patterns simplify the design by establishing relationships between entities.
 * These patterns help to shape the larger structure of the system while increasing its flexibility.
 *
 * 1. Adapter
 * 2. Bridge
 * 3. Composite
 * 4. Decorator
 * 5. Facade
 * 6. Flyweight
 * 7. Proxy
 *
 * ### Behavioral Design Patterns
 * Behavioral design patterns improve communication between objects, making operations more flexible.
 * These patterns facilitate the distribution of responsibilities and interactions among objects.
 *
 * 1. Chain of Responsibility
 * 2. Command
 * 3. Interpreter
 * 4. Iterator
 * 5. Mediator
 * 6. Memento
 * 7. Observer
 * 8. State
 * 9. Strategy
 * 10. Template Method
 * 11. Visitor
 *
 * ### Creational Design Patterns
 * Creational design patterns control the object creation process by centralizing it.
 * These patterns simplify the maintenance and development of the software by hiding the complexity of object creation and facilitating code usability.
 *
 * 1. Abstract Factory
 * 2. Builder
 * 3. Factory Method
 * 4. Prototype
 * 5. Singleton
 *
 * This list encompasses commonly used design patterns in software architecture, each providing solutions to specific problems.
 * Proper use of these design patterns can significantly enhance the sustainability and scalability of software projects.
